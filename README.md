## Prerequisites

Node.js and npm are essential to run it locally. You also need to install TypeScript.

If you have npm installed, you can install TypeScript globally (-g) on your computer by:

```bash
npm install -g typescript
```

You can test your install by checking the version or help.

```bash
tsc --version
tsc --help
```

Install the npm packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```bash
npm install
```

## Run

```bash
cd src
tsc <file-name>.ts
node <file-name>.js
```

## Test

```bash
npm test
```
